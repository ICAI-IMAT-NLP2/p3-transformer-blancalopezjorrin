While it may be a bit plain, it avoids the repetition and confusion seen in Greedy, Temperature, Top-k, and Top-p outputs. The other strategies introduce creative elements or phrasing errors, but Beam search gives a readable and faithful narrative that can be easily expanded into a full story if needed."

This setup achieved the highest BLEU-4 score (21.14) and produced translations that were faithful to the original text, fluent, and coherent. Greedy search was close but slightly lower in accuracy, while stochastic strategies like Temperature, Top-k, and Top-p added diversity but significantly reduced fidelity, leading to lower BLEU scores. The conclusion is that for translation tasks where accuracy is critical, deterministic strategies with beam search are preferable, while stochastic methods are more suited for creative or exploratory generation, not exact translation.\n",

Greedy search was unusable due to repetitive output, while stochastic strategies like Temperature, Top-k, and Top-p introduced creativity but often produced confusing or irrelevant content. The conclusion is that for tasks requiring clarity and fidelity to a prompt, deterministic strategies like beam search work best, whereas stochastic sampling is better suited for generating creative variations that may need human refinement."
